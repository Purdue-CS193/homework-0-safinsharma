## Optional Extra - Change the Theme of Your Website
If you aren't a fan of the super cool hacker theme that I chose to be the default of your website, you can easily change it.
Navigate to the settings page for your **Purdue-CS193/homework-0-\<Your Github Username\>** and scroll down to the **GitHub Pages** section. Click on **Change theme** and pick your favorite theme!
